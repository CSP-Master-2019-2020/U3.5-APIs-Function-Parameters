# Learning Targets

Students will be able to:
* Define and call simple functions that simplify turtle drawing tasks.
* Recognize functions in programs as a form of abstraction.
* Write a program that solves a turtle drawing problem using multiple levels of abstraction (i.e. functions that call other functions).
* Explain why and how functions can make code easier to read and maintain.
